<h2>Project 1: Capsule Neural Networks for Animal/Human Pose
Estimation</h2>
<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> <a href="https://alt-5a33b54d59cd9.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-3537097-dt-content-rid-36880238_1/courses/MGD_CS4525_CS4529_CS4594_23/READ_ONLY/content/_3537092_1/georgios.leontidis@abdn.ac.uk">Georgios Leontidis</a><br>
<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / ML</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNet) have
been shown to be better learners of object properties in images compared
to convolutional neural networks. There are several theories as to why
that is the case but the routing mechanism that models the part-whole
relationships helps to capture [viewpoint equivariance]
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02664.pdf). This project will use open
datasets to develop a CapsNet model to estimate animal/human pose. The
student will explore the suitability of several open datasets that exist
in this area and upon deciding which one to use they will then go on to
develop a CapsNet model based on a few routing mechanisms, e.g.
[VarCaps]
(https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/5785/5641). A
baseline ResNet 50 CNN model will be used to compare with all variations
of CapsNet models. It is anticipated that the student will work
alongside a current PhD student, and target a journal/conference paper
publication whilst writing up the L4 dissertation.</p>

plan to create an automatic tool that can model individual "moral
patterns" by showing successive decision scenarios with minimal changes
and predicting decisions.</p>

<h2>Project 9: Hierarchical Goal Network Planning</h2>
<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> <a href="https://alt-5a33b54d59cd9.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-3537097-dt-content-rid-36880238_1/courses/MGD_CS4525_CS4529_CS4594_23/READ_ONLY/content/_3537092_1/felipe.meneguzzi@abdn.ac.uk">Felipe Meneguzzi</a><br>
<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / General</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> While classical planning in state
spaces require minimal domain engineering, but can be inefficient for
domains in where domain-independent heuristics provide uninformed cost
estimates. By contrast Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning allow
domain engineers to encode a substantial amount of guidance for the
underlying algorithms. This comes at the cost of of substantial domain
engineering, and the risk of an engineer to provide domain knowledge
that turns the problem undecidable. Hierarchical Goal Network (HGN)
mitigate this problem by merging both approaches using a new formalism.
This formalism, however, has no currently open sourced planners
available. Thus this project consists of implementing an HGN planner
using a formalism like <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/350.pdf">GoDel</a>,
ideally with <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14979/14175">Heuristics

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / General;Computational Modelling</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Microorganisms have the ability to
produce a variety of precursor biochemicals that can be used to
synthesise products we use everyday, such as food additives,
pharmaceutic products and laundry detergents, from renewable biomass
resources. Microbial bioproduction processes hold great promise to
replace petroleum-based production which is considered environmentally
harmful. However, natural microbial systems have evolved to survive in
given conditions and therefore do not necessarily overproduce
biochemicals of interest to engineers. Thus, this project is about to
develop computational model of cell metabolism and physiology to allow a
system-level of understanding the complexity of cell activities and
function regulation. With such a model, we would like to investigate
what and where (genetic ) changes can be made in cells to strive a
balance between cellular objectives and engineering objectives. \</p>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / ML;AI / General</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Physics-based reasoning and machine
learning are both useful for decision making. However, they are often
investigated in isolation and it remains unclear as to what extent the
synergy between the two techniques can be achieved. While Machine
learning has been sucessful in a range of applications, the rules learnt
from the data may not be physically consistent (such as temperature
drops as winter comes, cars use more fuel at high speed, etc). This
project will explore such synergy in several selected problems,
including crop yield forcasting and biochemical reaction rate prediction
. We have already had simple physical models of such problems and we aim
to create machine learning models that make most of information embeded
in physical models to make sure machine learning models conform to law
of physics while improving prediction performance.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / General;Software Engineering</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Dynamic optimisation is a field of
making optimal decisions in dynamic environments. For example, the
railway network operator is required to make timely decisions in railway
scheduling whenever there is a change (train breakdown, adverse weather,
disruptions ) to the system so as to reduce the impact on passengers as
well as running costs. There have been various dynamic optimisation
algorithms available for a rang of dynamic problems (mostly artificial
ones that simplify the complexity of real-world applications). These
algorithms are developed by different researchers and implemented with
different programming languages. The lack of a standard framework for
such implementations make users difficult to choose and compare
algorithms. This project aims to develop a software platform that
integrates popular dynamic optimisation algorithms and standardises
their implementation in a single programming language (either python or
matlab) in a user-friendly manner. The software will be for education
and research purposes. Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is expected the candidate student has excellent programming
skills, good knowledge of software engineering, and ability to
reproduce/re-implement algorithms proposed by others in a preferred
language.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Do you want to know how much carbon you
favorite vegetables consume during its growth cycle ? How much do
vegetable crops contribute to carbon reduction for environmental
sustainability ? Working with several farming companies, this project
aims to quantify the carbon consumption of selected crops during its
growth cycle while taking into account environmental factors, such as
weather data, fertiliser usage, irrigation, etc. The project involves
data analysis, carbon accounting/carbon modelling to estimate carbon
fixation benefits brought about by vegetable farming, informing farmers
to optimise their farming practice for improving productivity as well as
reducing carbon emissions. Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an interdisciplinary project, requiring ability and
willingness to work closely with industrial partners. Students
interested in carbon reduction are encouraged to apply.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> With the ever-increasing volume of
massive data, researchers and businesses are facing challenges in
efficient handling of big data to inform their decision making. If you
are a person who would like to research what can be done for big data
analysis, then this project provides you a perfect opportunity to learn
how to deal with massive data (more than 2GB and tens of millions of
entries) . The data to be used for this project is from soil science
which aims to analyse soil biodiversity. The research question to be
answered is: Can metagenomes from surface and surface soils in Scotland
help to identify the features that most discriminate surface and
subsurface soils from each other? Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; This is a data science project,
therefore it is desired that the candidate has an interest in machine
learning (although other approaches can be used but it likely that
machine learning will help).</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/">North Sea Transition Authority
(NSTA)</a> regulates and influences the oil, gas and carbon storage
industries. The NSTA works with government, industry and other
regulators to accelerate the move to net zero while meeting the UKâ€™s
energy demand and security. The NSTA is making more and more data it
collects freely available to industry, academia and others. In 2019 the
NSTA launched the National Data Repository (NDR), which stores
petroleum-related information and samples and is a key piece of UK
digital infrastructure. The NDR addresses many industry and regulatory
needs â€“ including: â€¢ Ensuring global access to unique and irreplaceable
petroleum-related information â€¢ Enabling the retention and reporting
obligations of relevant persons to be discharged â€¢ Enabling the
disclosure of petroleum-related information by the NSTA â€¢ Ensuring that
maximum value is derived from petroleum-related information by ensuring
the widest possible transparent access â€¢ Ensuring the sustainable
curation of petroleum-related information and samples â€¢ In future
applying the above principles to other data which the NSTA may hold or
disclose in fulfillment of the NSTA strategy supporting the energy
transition. The NDR stores over 5 Terabytes of data in its data
warehouse, which includes databases and tables of machine readable
information as well as scans of historic records, dating back to the
1970s. The machine readable data are easily accessible via the NDR
portal; however, there have been difficulties and issues with regard to
the historic records. These records, in particular, are a combination of
handwritten and typed, of varying quality based on how the original
documents were preserved, and saved as PDF and image files. Some areas
students could explore that would add value would be: â€¢ Creating
algorithms to review historic record PDFs and image files to extract
information, comparing/contrasting methodologies to improve accuracy â€¢
Based on the information extracted, derive analytics that could lead to
new insights with historic data â€¢ Detail processes for understanding and
analysing data that are scientifically verifiable and repeatable by
others, facilitating knowledge transfer partnerships For more

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / General</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Complex systems often require an
abstraction to symbolic models to allow for efficient planning. Task
planning is an active research area that concerns search algorithms and
heuristics to explore the state-space of a model in search of a solution
to a particular task. Hierarchical Task Planning (HTN) is an alternative
to traditional classical planning (STRIPS / PDDL), it incorporates more
information about the application domain via the description of methods
(non-primitive tasks). There are some alternatives for combining PDDL
and robots, but so far HTN has not been fully explored in robotic
applications. In this project, you will implement a bridge between an
existing HTN planner and the NVIDIA Isaac Sim robotics simulator. This
will be evaluated in existing robotic applications. Optional objectives
if time allows is to compare it against existing PDDL
implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:<br>

all of the tools. In particular, the most resource intensive is Isaac
Sim, please check the requirements <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_digital-twins/app_isaacsim/requirements.html">here</a>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / General</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Single-agent (centralised) planning has
been shown to suffer from scalability issues when dealing with problems
containing a large number of agents and goals. Multi-agent planners are
often domain specific to deal with the constraints and assumptions from
different application domains. A general approach to multi-agent
planning usually tackles this problem by performing factorisation
techniques to split it into sub-problems and then using a single-agent
planner to solve them. A recent multi-agent planner called EgoPlan has
been proposed for temporal problems (where actions have durations). In
this project, you will engineer coordination-intensive domains (based on
existing domains) to further evaluate EgoPlan and attempt to categorise
how coordination/interaction can be identified in planning domains and
problems, as well as looking into creating a metric for evaluating how
much coordination/interaction the planner made use of. Optional
objectives include expanding this study to other multi-agent
planners.</p>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> Software Engineering</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> ROSMonitoring is a Robot Operating
System (ROS) package for runtime verification of formal properties.
There is an experimental port of ROSMonitoring to ROS2, but it has not
been extensively tested yet. In the first part of this project, you will
test ROSMonitoring in several ROS2 applications that are simulated using
the Gazebo simulator and fix any issues encountered. In the second part
you will extend the ROSMonitoring to allow the dynamic creation of
runtime monitors, and then evaluate them in the previous set of
applications. As an optional objective you can look into adding new
"oracles" to add support for other logic formalisms.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: - You will need a computer with a
dedicated graphics card (reasonably recent) to be able to run the Gazebo
simulator, as well as having (or be willing to install) the operating
system Ubuntu 22.04 - Some knowledge about logic languages such as FOL,
LTL, etc. is desirable</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Object Detection is one of the most
important fields in Computer Vision and involves localising and
identifying objects of interest when presented with a scene. Previous
techniques used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve this,
with many diverse architectures having been developed in recent history.
These techniques, however, may be replaced entirely by Visual
Transformers (ViTs) â€“ a state-of-the-art idea adapted from the field of
Natural Language Processing. This project will explore the viability of
using ViTs to a custom dataset of sonar scenes, possibly with a
comparison against the traditional CNN approach. Implementation will use
the PyTorch library.</p>

<h2>Project 46: Exploring Bilingual vs. Language Learner Code Switching
Patterns in Dialogue</h2>
<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> <a href="https://alt-5a33b54d59cd9.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-3537097-dt-content-rid-36880238_1/courses/MGD_CS4525_CS4529_CS4594_23/READ_ONLY/content/_3537092_1/arabella.sinclair@abdn.ac.uk">Arabella Sinclair</a><br>
<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / NLP</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Code switching, or the choice of a
speaker to change language during a single interaction, is typical of
bilingual speakers, and can be useful to both teachers and learners in
second language (L2) tuition. Understanding and predicting appropriate
use of code switching in this setting has the potential to greatly
enhance current computer aided language learning technologies, as well
as provide an evaluation of existing multilingual representations. This
project will involve making use of the multilingual representations
afforded to us by models such as BLOOM and using them to explore and
compare the code switching behaviour of a) native Spanish/Catalan
learners of English, and b) bilingual speakers of Spanish and English,
in a dialogue setting. Initially some exploratory data analysis of the
two corpora will be carried out, following clustering of utterance
embeddings extracted from BLOOM based on cosine similarity (to measure
semantic similarity) for both the languages in the dataset. From this,
this project aims to answer open research questions such as a) how
semantically similar are the two languages used in these dialogues? Does
this vary with learner ability level? Do clusters represent different
uses of the second language in these learner dialogues, and does this
differ from its purpose in bilingual dialogue? This work will build on
existing work (in press, will be shared in confidence with the student
working on this project) examining the role of code switching and
alignment in learner dialogue, applying modern techniques to the
analysis and uses of code switching in second language learner dialogue.
Depending on the ability and ambition of the student, this project can
also attempt to predict the incidence of code switching in an L2
setting. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any
questions about the project. <strong>Datasets</strong> - Bilingual

<h2>Project 47: Interpreting Transformer Attention During Next Utterance
Dialogue Generation from Human Contexts</h2>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / NLP</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Transformer language models are
increasingly proficient at generating convincingly human-like language,
even when generating dialogue. Humans have been found to adapt and align
their language to one another in dialogue, a convincing model of
dialogue should do the same. This project aims to explore what features
of the dialogue context provided to the model most influence a modelâ€™s
generation of a proposed next utterance. It will then compare the
influence the context has on itâ€™s comprehension of the human utterance
that came next in the true dialogue data. From this comparison, as well
as building on work measuring the degree of vocabulary overlap between
human vs machine â€˜speakersâ€™ we can analyse and evaluate the degree to
which model generation behaviour is human-like and where this diverges,
through the perspective of linguistic alignment. The addition of
interpretability techniques will allow our analysis to be more fine
grained: exploring to what extent the model attends to different
speakers in the preceding dialogue context, and answering questions
about between vs within speaker alignment differences between humans and
language models. <strong>Expectations</strong>: Student will have strong
programming skills, a good working knowledge of python, and is willing
to learn and work with transformer language models, such as gpt2, T5, or
Dialogpt. This project will require the use of multiple libraries for
analysis, and potentially making use of the Macleod server for
performing some experiments, depending on the ability/ambition of the
student. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any

<h2>Project 48: Towards Evaluating Creativity in Language</h2>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / NLP</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Humans use language creatively in many
settings for many purposes, either for humour, creating written works of
art such as poetry, creative writing or theatre, or even in their
everyday language use. Some language is created with the intent to
convey factual information, in this setting, use of abstraction,
metaphor, or ambiguous language, is undesirable, and thus potentially
limits the degree to which we categorise this language as creative This
project aims to explore what linguistic markers can robustly
characterise language that humans find creative and appealing, using a
variety of measures drawn from areas of psycholinguistics and evaluating
them on texts selected both for their creativity and for their relative
lack thereof. We can then use these markers to evaluate and compare the
extent to which machine-generated texts display these creative traits,
independent of their success in displaying other desirable properties in
generation such as fluency or coherence. We aim to address the
hypothesis that creativity in language is independent of fluency, and
that it is a quantity that both varies depending on context and
individual human opinion. We will explore how these features vary across
text of different genres, using a feature based and neural classifier to
score texts for creativity. We will then (depending on the ability &amp;
ambitions of the student) design and conduct a small human evaluation of
language snippets from human and model generated texts to investigate to
what extent the properties discovered correlate with human judgement of
creative language use. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me if you
have any questions about the project. <strong>Datasets</strong>: - <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04833.pdf">Hierarchical neural story

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / NLP</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Multilingual models capture semantics
about words in different languages, granting them increased semantic
capabilities over lower resource languages. However, semantic
associations for words can vary across languages and the cultures that
speak them, for example, colour and emotion associations have been shown
to vary by culture. Do multilingual language models capture the same
language and thus culturally specific associations? This project will
use as a case study a dataset in English containing human data on
emotion-word associations, and evaluate the degree of difference between
modelâ€™s semantic representation for these words in comparison to their
corresponding emotion across selected languages. We will then compare
this to human data for colour-emotion relationship in Japanese, as well
as colour emotion relationship (gathered in English) for Indian speakers
of English. We thus have 3 distinct populations to compare
representations across. Understanding the cultural variations in
semantic differences between words can be very important for downstream
applications such as sentiment classification in reviews, or simply in
evaluating texts in terms of coherence. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach
out to me if you have any questions about the project.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this project, we are interested in
implementing and investigating problems related to the navigation of a
TurtleBot 3 robot. This robot is equipped with wheels, a camera and a
LIDAR, and will be lent to the student for the duration of the project.
Please note that it is highly recommended that the student selected for
this project is equipped with a LINUX computer (and not a virtual box).
Examples of projects are provided in the preliminary reading.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Recently, Chrome introduced its next
generation extension platform, namely Manifest V3. Manifest V3
represents one of the most significant shifts in the extensions platform
since it launched a decade ago. Manifest V3 extensions enjoy
enhancements in security, privacy, and performance.</p>
<p>In this project, you will build a malicious chrome extension under
the manifest V3 and evaluate the functionalities and effectiveness of
your malicious software, thus provide an insight of how bad an extension
can be and how well the Manifest V3's protect the users.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is to estimate the outcome
of a treatment applied to a disease or other data sources. You will be
provided with a medical data or energy data where it contains the
control and treatment subjects. The aims are to create a deep learning
system to predict the treatment and as well as the caused outcomes. You
may also need to infer the causal factors. Causal effect estimation
could be applied in many different areas; essentially the task is to
estimate the counterfactuals which is the potential outcome if an action
was made. This is important for decision-making. A typical example is
that what would be the potential outcome of the effect when lockdown was
set one month before the lockdown which was actually set.</p>

<h2>Project 54: Variational parallel tempering</h2>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / ML</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Inference for multi-modal
distributions/models are challenging since there are more than one modes
in the model. For example, four-armed planar robots have four equivalent
modes and therefore it is crucial to infer all these modes. In this
project, our aim is to devise scalable inferential algorithms to model
multi-modal distributions. Variational inference will be used with
parallel tempering techniques. Our algorithm will be able to scale to
big data whist employing the power of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
standard. The algorithm will be applied to two and four-armed planar
robots and/or differential equations. Ideally, for doing this project,
you may be interested in statistical methods including MCMC and
variational inference. You should be able to programme with Python and
using TensorFlow. This project is not suitable for joint honours
students except that they are familiar with these requirements.</p>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / ML</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In machine learning and statistics, we
are often estimate integrals using Monte Carlo estimates. But the
variance is usually too high and thus it is required to reduce the
variance when applying Monte Carlo estimates. In the project, we are
using deep learning approach to automatically reduce the variance of
Monte Carlo estimates.</p>

<strong>Project Areas:</strong> AI / ML</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this project, you will use deep
learning models to segment images; these images would be dental X-ray
images. Various deep learning models will be applied to the data.
Potentially, the task would be instance segmentation, for example,
numbering the teeth given the scanned X-ray images.</p>
